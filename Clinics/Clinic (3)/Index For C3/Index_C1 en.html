<h2>Meditation & Mindfulness: A Guide to Inner Peace and Clarity</h2>
<p><b>What is Meditation?</b><br>
    Meditation is a mental practice where an individual uses techniques like focusing on<br>
     a particular object, thought, or activity to train attention and awareness,<br>
      achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm state.
      <br>
  <b>What is Mindfulness?</b> <br>   
      Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the moment, <br> 
      aware of where you are and what you're doing, without being <br> 
      overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's happening around you.
      <br>
